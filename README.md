# The Guide: Hitchhiker-Python
Plugin-based project for python-speaking hitchhikers to communicate with Sub-Etha via Babel Fish.

## The Guide
### What is `The Guide`
Based on The Guide, described by Douglas Adams in his famously absurd trilogy of 5 (or 6) books (Radio Series, TV Series, Comic Books, Movie and more) as:
> The Guide is a huge virtual encyclopedia with many articles and researches about the wonders of the universe.  

Among the many mentioned by the characters during Douglas Adams's novels, you can find:  
* The Recipe for a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster  
* Towel  
* Babel Fish  
* Infinite Improbability Drive

*In terms of the platform:*  
The Guide is a language agnostic, distributed state machine platform for running home automations written in any language, for any project in an attempt to categorize and control the state of your universe.

### What is a `Hitchhiker`
Hitchhikers are exactly what you'd expect them to be if interstellar travel were more prevalent. A Hitchhiker will stow aboard passing ships by utilizing an Electronic Thumb and travel the universe - and always knows where their towel is.
  
*In terms of the platform:*  
A hitchhiker is an integration - services, devices, data sources, they are all hitching a ride and it doesn't matter where they come from or the language they speak.

### What is a `Babel Fish`
A babel fish is a small fish that you put in your ear and translates any and all foreign languages into your native tongue - perfect for the hitchhikers that choose to see the galaxy on less than thirty Altairian dollars a day.

*In terms of the platform:*  
The babel fish is the layer between a hitchhiker and the Sub-Etha, translating messages to or from either entity. 

### What is `Sub-Etha`
The Sub-Etha is the data network that spans the galaxy, it connects all modern lifeforms.
  
*In terms of the platform:*  
The Sub-Etha is a publish/subscribe system that carries messages between hitchhikers or even Deepthought

### What is `Deepthought`
Millions of years ago, the philosophers of Magrathea commissioned the construction of a super computer that could answer the **Ultimate Question**: "What is the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything?" but you definitely won't like the answer.
  
*In terms of the platform:*  
Deepthought is the decision engine that manipulates hitchhikers based on the state of the Sub-Etha network - the brains of the system, if you will.
