## The Guide
### What is `The Guide`
Based on The Guide, described by Douglas Adams in his famously absurd trilogy of 5 (or 6) books (Radio Series, TV Series, Comic Books, Movie and more) as:
> The Guide is a huge virtual encyclopedia with many articles and researches about the wonders of the universe.  

Among the many mentioned by the characters during Douglas Adams's novels, you can find:  
* The Recipe for a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster  
* Towel  
* Babel Fish  
* Infinite  

The Guide is a language agnostic, distributed state machine platform for running home automations written in any language, for any project in an attempt to categorize the state of your universe.

### What is a `Hitchhiker`
Hitchhikers are exactly what you'd expect them to be if interstellar travel were more prevalent. A Hitchhiker will stow aboard passing ships by utilizing an Electronic Thumb and travel the universe - and always knows where their towel is.

### What is a `Babel Fish`
A babel fish is a small fish that you put in your ear and translates any and all foreign languages into your native tongue - perfect for the hitchhikers that choose to see the galaxy on less than thirty Altairian dollars a day.

### What is `Sub-Etha`
TBD
